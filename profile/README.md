This is the home for my graduation project. It's a elearning system with AI-generated content.

## Plan
This project should not be optimized for production for any time soon.
Start date: 24/11/2025
End date (est.): 01/12/2025

## Tech Stack
I decided to use Spring Cloud architecture for backend and Nextjs for Frontend.
Each backend service would have their own Postgres instance, and share the same message queue (RabbitMQ) and cache (Redis)
